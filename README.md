## Project Description
We were given a csv file that had the stock prices for a particular stock. The dataset contained 9 weeks worth of data to gather information from. We had utlize OOP knowledge to determine the mean, median, and standard deviation of the dataset. 

Coming up with the mean, median, abd standard deviation, we could further develop a more solid predictioon of where that particular stock could be in the upcoming weeks.
